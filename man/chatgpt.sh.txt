DESCRIPTION

This script acts as a wrapper for ChatGPT, DALL-E, STT (Whisper), and
TTS endpoints from OpenAI. Various service providers such as LocalAI,
Ollama, Anthropic, Mistral AI, GoogleAI, Groq AI, GitHub Models, Novita,
xAI, and DeepSeek APIs are supported.

By default, the script runs in single-turn of chat completion mode,
processing INPUT directly when no options are set.

Handles single-turn and multi-turn modes, pure text and native chat
completions, image generation and editing, speech-to-text, and
text-to-speech models.

Positional arguments are read as a single PROMPT. Some functions such as
Whisper (STT) and TTS may handle optional positional parameters before
the text prompt itself.

CHAT COMPLETION MODE

Set option -c to start a multi-turn chat mode via text completions with
history support. This option works with instruct models, defaults to
gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct if none set.

Set options -cc to start the chat mode via native chat completions. This
mode defaults to the gpt-5 model, which is optimised to follow
instructions.

On options -bb, the Responses API endpoint is set preferentially.

In chat mode, some options are automatically set to un-lobotomise the
bot.

While using other providers, mind that options -c, -cc, and -bb set
different endpoints! These options must be set according to the model
capabilities!

Set option -C to resume (continue from) last history session, and set
option -E to exit on the first response (even in multi turn mode).

TEXT COMPLETION MODE 

Option -d starts a single-turn session in plain text completions, no
history support. This does not set further options automatically, such
as instruction or temperature.

To run the script in text completion in multi-turn mode and history
support, set command line options -dd.

Set text completion models such as gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct.

INSERT MODE (Fill-In-the-Middle)

Set option -q for insert mode in single-turn and option -qq for
multi-turn. The flag “[insert]” must be present in the middle of the
input prompt. Insert mode works completing between the end of the text
preceding the flag, and ends completion with the succeeding text after
the flag.

Insert mode works with `instruct’ and Mistral `code’ models.

RESPONSES API

Responses API is a superset of Chat Completions API. Set command line
option -b (with -cc), or set options -bb for multi-turn.

To activate it during multi-turn chat, set /responses [model], where
model is the name of a model which works with the Responses API. Aliased
to /resp [model] and -b [model]. This can be toggled.

Limited support.

INSTRUCTION PROMPTS

The SYSTEM INSTRUCTION prompt may be set with option -S or via envars
$INSTRUCTION and $INSTRUCTION_CHAT.

Option -S sets an INSTRUCTION prompt (the initial prompt) for text
cmpls, and chat cmpls. A text file path may be supplied as the single
argument. Also see CUSTOM / AWESOME PROMPTS section below.

To create and reuse a custom prompt, set the prompt name as a command
line option, such as “-S .[_prompt_name_]” or “-S ,[_prompt_name_]”.

When the operator is a comma “,”, single-shot editing will be available
after loading the prompt text. Use double “,,” to actually edit the
template file itself!

Note that loading a custom prompt will also change to its
respectively-named history file.

Alternatively, set the first positional argument with the operator and
the prompt name after any command line options, such as
“chatgpt;sh -cc .[_prompt_name_]”. This loads the prompt file unless
instruction was set with command line options.

To prepend the current date and time to the instruction prompt, set
command line option --time.

For TTS gpt-4o-tts model type instructions, set command line option
-S "[instruction]" when invoking the script with option -z only
(stand-alone TTS mode). Alternatively, set envar $INSTRUCTION_SPEECH.

Note that for audio models such as gpt-4o-audio, the user can control
tone and accent of the rendered voice output with a robust `INSTRUCTION’
as usual.

Prompt Engineering and Design

Minimal INSTRUCTION to behave like a chatbot is given with chat
options -cc, unless otherwise explicitly set by the user.

On chat mode, if no INSTRUCTION is set, minimal instruction is given,
and some options auto set, such as increasing temp and presence penalty,
in order to un-lobotomise the bot. With cheap and fast models of text
cmpls, such as Curie, the `best_of’ option may be worth setting (to 2 or
3).

Prompt engineering is an art on itself. Study carefully how to craft the
best prompts to get the most out of text, code and chat cmpls models.

Certain prompts may return empty responses. Maybe the model has nothing
to further complete input or it expects more text. Try trimming spaces,
appending a full stop/ellipsis, resetting temperature, or adding more
text.

Prompts ending with a space character may result in lower quality
output. This is because the API already incorporates trailing spaces in
its dictionary of tokens.

Note that the model’s steering and capabilities require prompt
engineering to even know that it should answer the questions.

MODEL AND CAPACITY

Set model with “-m [MODEL]”, with MODEL as its name, or set it as “.” to
pick from the model list.

List models with option -l or run /models in chat mode.

Set maximum response tokens with option “-NUM” or “-M NUM”. This
defaults to 4096 tokens and 25000 for reasoning models, or disabled when
running on chat completions and responses endpoints.

If a second NUM is given to this option, maximum model capacity will
also be set. The option syntax takes the form of “-NUM/NUM”, and “-M
NUM-NUM”.

Model capacity (maximum model tokens) can be set more intuitively with
option “-N NUM”, otherwise model capacity is set automatically for known
models or to 8000 tokens as fallback.

Option -y sets python tiktoken instead of the default script hack to
preview token count. This option makes token count preview accurate and
fast (we fork tiktoken as a coprocess for fast token queries). Useful
for rebuilding history context independently from the original model
used to generate responses.

SPEECH-TO-TEXT (Whisper)

Option -w transcribes audio speech from mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, m4a, wav,
webm, flac and ogg files. First positional argument must be an
AUDIO/VOICE file. Optionally, set a TWO-LETTER input language
(ISO-639-1) as the second argument. A PROMPT may also be set to guide
the model’s style, or continue a previous audio segment. The text prompt
should match the speech language.

Note that option -w can also be set to translate speech input to any
text language to the target language.

Option -W translates speech stream to English text. A PROMPT in English
may be set to guide the model as the second positional argument.

Set these options twice to have phrasal-level timestamps, options -ww
and -WW. Set thrice for word-level timestamps.

Combine options -wW with options -bcc to start chat with voice input
(Whisper) support. Additionally, set option -z to enable text-to-speech
(TTS) models and voice out.

TEXT-TO-VOICE (TTS)

Option -z synthesises voice from text (TTS models). Set a voice as the
first positional parameter (“alloy”, “echo”, “fable”, “onyx”, “nova”, or
“shimmer”). Set the second positional parameter as the voice speed
(0.25 - 4.0), and, finally the output file name or the format, such as
“./new_audio.mp3” (“mp3”, “wav”, “flac”, “opus”, “aac”, or “pcm16”); or
set “-” for stdout.

Do mind that PlayAI (supported by Groq AI) has different output formats
such as “mulaw” and “ogg”, as well as different voice names such as
Aaliyah-PlayAI, Adelaide-PlayAI, Angelo-PlayAI, etc.

Set options -zv to not play received output.

MULTIMODAL AUDIO MODELS

Audio models, such as gpt-4o-audio, deal with audio input and output
directly.

To activate the microphone recording function of the script, set command
line option -w.

Otherwise, the audio model accepts any compatible audio file (such as
mp3, wav, and opus). These files can be added to be loaded at the very
end of the user prompt or added with chat command “/audio
path/to/file.mp3”.

To activate the audio synthesis output mode of an audio model, make sure
to set command line option -z!

IMAGE GENERATIONS AND EDITS (Dall-E)

Option -i generates images according to text PROMPT. If the first
positional argument is an IMAGE file, then generate variations of it. If
the first positional argument is an IMAGE file and the second a MASK
file (with alpha channel and transparency), and a text PROMPT
(required), then edit the IMAGE according to MASK and PROMPT. If MASK is
not provided, IMAGE must have transparency.

The size of output images may be set as the first positional parameter
in the command line:

    gpt-image: "_1024x1024_" (_L_, _Large_, _Square_), "_1536x1024_" (_X_, _Landscape_), or "_1024x1536_" (_P_, _Portrait_).

    dall-e-3: "_1024x1024_" (_L_, _Large_, _Square_), "_1792x1024_" (_X_, _Landscape_), or "_1024x1792_" (_P_, _Portrait_).

    dall-e-2: "_256x256_" (_Small_), "_512x512_" (_M_, _Medium_), or "_1024x1024_" (_L_, _Large_).

A parameter “high”, “medium”, “low”, or “auto” may also be appended to
the size parameter to set image quality with gpt-image, such as “Xhigh”
or “1563x1024high”. Defaults=1024x1024auto.

The parameter “hd” or “standard” may also be set for image quality with
dall-e-3.

For dall-e-3, optionally set the generation style as either “natural” or
“vivid” as one of the first positional parameters at command line
invocation.

Note that the user needs to verify his organisation to use gpt-image
models!

See IMAGES section below for more information on inpaint and outpaint.

TEXT / CHAT COMPLETIONS

1. Text Completion

Given a prompt, the model will return one or more predicted completions.
For example, given a partial input, the language model will try
completing it until probable “<|endoftext|>”, or other stop sequences
(stops may be set with -s "\[stop-seq]").

Restart and start sequences may be optionally set. Restart and start
sequences are not set automatically if the chat mode of text completions
is not activated with option -c.

Readline is set to work with multiline input and pasting from the
clipboard. Alternatively, set option -u to enable pressing <CTRL-D> to
flush input! Or set option -U to set cat command as input prompter.

Bash bracketed paste is enabled, meaning multiline input may be pasted
or typed, even without setting options -uU (v25.2+).

Language model SKILLS can be activated with specific prompts, see
https://platform.openai.com/examples.

2. Interactive Conversations

2.1 Text Completions Chat

Set option -c to start chat mode of text completions. It keeps a history
file, and keeps new questions in context. This works with a variety of
models. Set option -E to exit on response.

2.2 Native Chat Completions

Set the double option -cc to start chat completions mode. More recent
models are also the best option for many non-chat use cases.

2.3 Q & A Format

The defaults chat format is “Q & A”. The restart sequence “\nQ: ” and
the start text “\nA:” are injected for the chat bot to work well with
text cmpls.

In multi-turn interactions, special prefixes allow prompt
manipulation: * :_PROMPT_ - Prepends text to the current user prompt
before sending. * ::_PROMPT_ - Prepends text to the system instruction
for the current turn. * ::: - Re-injects the original system instruction
into the request, useful for reinforcing instructions after long
conversations.

Entering exactly triple colons “:::” reinjects a system instruction
prompt into the current request. This is useful to reinforce the
instruction when the model’s context has been truncated.

2.4 Voice input (STT), and voice output (TTS)

The options -bccwz may be combined to have voice recording input and
synthesised voice output, specially nice with chat modes. When setting
flag -w or flag -z, the first positional parameters are read as STT or
TTS arguments. When setting both flags -wz, add a double hyphen to set
first STT, and then TTS arguments.

Set chat mode, plus voice-in transcription language code and text
prompt, and the TTS voice-out option argument:

    chatgpt.sh -bccwz  en 'transcription prompt'  --  nova

2.5 Vision and Multimodal Models

To send an image or url to vision models, either set the image with the
“!img” command with one or more filepaths / urls.

    chatgpt.sh -cc -m gpt-4-vision-preview '!img path/to/image.jpg'

Alternatively, set the image paths / urls at the end of the text prompt
interactively:

    chatgpt.sh -cc -m gpt-4-vision-preview

    [...]
    Q: In this first user prompt, what can you see?  https://i.imgur.com/wpXKyRo.jpeg

Make sure file paths containing spaces are backslash-escaped!

2.6 Text, PDF, Doc, and URL Dumps

The user may add a filepath or URL to the end of the prompt. The file is
then read and the text content added to the user prompt. This is a basic
text feature that works with any model.

    chatgpt.sh -cc

    [...]
    Q: What is this page: https://example.com

    Q: Help me study this paper. ~/Downloads/Prigogine\ Perspective\ on\ Nature.pdf

In the second example, the PDF will be dumped as text.

For PDF text dump support, poppler/abiword is required. For doc and odt
files, LibreOffice is required. See the Optional Packages section.

Also note that file paths containing white spaces must be
backslash-escaped, or the file path must be preceded by a pipe `|’
character.

Multiple images and audio files may be added to the request in this way!

COMMAND LIST

While in chat mode, the following commands can be invoked to change
parameters and manage sessions.

-   Commands can start with either “!” or “/” and are usually
    equivalent.
-   Commands with colon (:) add their output to the current prompt
    buffer.
-   Commands with double dagger ‡ execute as as suffix command, see
    examples below.

: Commands with colons add their output to the current prompt buffer.

‡ Double daggers indicates suffix-commands, invoked at the end of the
user prompt and preceded by space.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Examples

  “/temp 0.7”, “!modgpt-5”, “-p 0.2”

  “/session HIST_NAME”, “[PROMPT] /pick”

  “[PROMPT] /sh”, “Translate this to French /sh”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some options can be disabled and excluded from the request by setting a
“-1” as argument (bypass with “-1.0”)

  “!presence -1”, “-a -1”, “-t-1”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Response Regeneration

To regenerate response, type in the command “!regen” or a single
exclamation mark or forward slash in the new empty prompt. In order to
edit the prompt before the request, try “!!” (or “//”).

Shell and File Integration

The “/pick” command opens a file picker (usually a command-line file
manager). The selected file path will be appended to the current prompt
in editing mode.

The “/sh” and “/pick” commands may be run when typed at the end of the
current prompt, such as “[PROMPT] /sh”, which opens a new shell instance
to execute commands interactively. Shell command or file dumps are
appended to the current prompt.

Any command prefixed with a single exclamation mark (!CMD) that does not
match a built-in command is executed by the shell. This is a shortcut
for !sh CMD, and its standard output is appended to the current prompt.

To execute a shell command without appending its output, use the double
exclamation mark form explicitly (!!sh CMD). This shell execution
facility is exclusive to the ! operator.

API Parameter Injection

Envar $BLOCK_USR can be set to raw model options in JSON syntax,
according to each API, to be injected in the request block.
Alternatively, run command “!block [ARGS]” during chat mode.

Session Management

A history file can hold a single session or multiple sessions. When it
holds a single session, the name of the history file and the session are
the same. However, in case the user breaks a session, the last one (the
tail session) of that history file is always loaded when the resume
option -C is set.

The script uses a TSV file to record entries, which is kept at the
script cache directory (“~/.cache/chatgptsh/”). The tail session of the
history file can always be read and resumed.

Run command “/list [glob]” with optional “glob” to list session /
history “tsv” files. When glob is “.” list all files in the cache
directory; when “pr” list all instruction prompt files; and when “awe”
list all awesome prompts.

Changing Session

A new history file can be created or changed to with command “/session
[HIST_NAME]”, in which HIST_NAME is the file name or path of a history
file.

On invocation, when the first positional argument to the script follows
the syntax “/[HIST_NAME]”, the command “/session” is assumed (with
options -bccCdPP).

Resuming and Copying Sessions

To continue from an old session type in a dot “.” or “/.” as the first
positional argument from the command line on invocation.

The above command is a shortcut of “/copy current current”. In fact,
there are multiple commands to copy and resume from an older session
(the dot means current session): “/copy . .”, “/fork.”, “/sub”, and
“/grep [REGEX]”.

From the command line on invocation, simply type “.” as the first
positional argument.

It is possible to copy sessions of a history file to another file when a
second argument is given to the “/copy” command.

Mind that forking a session will change to the destination history file
and resume from it as opposed to just copying it.

History File Editing

To edit chat context at run time, the history file may be modified with
the “/hist” command (also good for context injection).

Delete history entries or comment them out with “#”.

CUSTOM / AWESOME PROMPTS

When the argument to option -S starts with a full stop, such as “-S
.my_prompt”, load, search for, or create my_prompt prompt file. If two
full stops are prepended to the prompt name, load it silently. If a
comma is used instead, such as “-S ,my_prompt”, edit the prompt file,
and then load it.

When the argument to option -S starts with a backslash or a percent
sign, such as “-S /linux_terminal”, search for an
awesome-chatgpt-prompt(-zh) (by Fatih KA and PlexPt). Set “//” or “%%”
to refresh local cache. Use with davinci and gpt-3.5+ models.

These options also set corresponding history files automatically.

Please note and make sure to backup your important custom prompts! They
are located at “~/.cache/chatgptsh/” with the extension “.pr”.

IMAGES / DALL-E

1. Image Generations

An image can be created given a text prompt. A text PROMPT of the
desired image(s) is required. The maximum length is 1000 characters.

This script also supports xAI image generation model with invocation
“chatgpt.sh --xai -i -m grok-2-image-1212 "[prompt]"”.

2. Image Variations

Variations of a given IMAGE can be generated. The IMAGE to use as the
basis for the variations must be a valid PNG file, less than 4MB and
square.

3. Image Edits

To edit an IMAGE, a MASK file may be optionally provided. If MASK is not
provided, IMAGE must have transparency, which will be used as the mask.
A text prompt is required.

3.1 ImageMagick

If ImageMagick is available, input IMAGE and MASK will be checked and
processed to fit dimensions and other requirements.

3.2 Transparent Colour and Fuzz

A transparent colour must be set with “-@[COLOUR]” to create the mask.
Defaults=black.

By defaults, the COLOUR must be exact. Use the `fuzz option’ to match
colours that are close to the target colour. This can be set with
“-@[VALUE%]” as a percentage of the maximum possible intensity, for
example “-@10%black”.

-   https://imagemagick.org/script/color.php
-   https://imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.php#fuzz

3.3 Mask File / Alpha Channel

An alpha channel is generated with ImageMagick from any image with the
set transparent colour (defaults to black). In this way, it is easy to
make a mask with any black and white image as a template.

3.4 In-Paint and Out-Paint

In-painting is achieved setting an image with a MASK and a prompt.

Out-painting can also be achieved manually with the aid of this script.
Paint a portion of the outer area of an image with alpha, or a defined
transparent colour which will be used as the mask, and set the same
colour in the script with option -@. Choose the best result amongst many
results to continue the out-painting process step-wise.

STT / VOICE-IN / WHISPER

Transcriptions

Transcribes audio file or voice record into the set language. Set a
two-letter ISO-639-1 language code (en, es, ja, or zh) as the positional
argument following the input audio file. A prompt may also be set as
last positional parameter to help guide the model. This prompt should
match the audio language.

If the last positional argument is “.” or “last” exactly, it will
resubmit the last recorded audio input file from cache.

Note that if the audio language is different from the set language code,
output will be on the language code (translation).

Translations

Translates audio into English. An optional text to guide the model’s
style or continue a previous audio segment is optional as last
positional argument. This prompt should be in English.

Setting temperature has an effect, the higher the more random.

PROVIDER INTEGRATIONS

For LocalAI integration, run the script with option --localai, or set
environment $OPENAI_BASE_URL with the server Base URL.

For Mistral AI set environment variable $MISTRAL_API_KEY, and run the
script with option --mistral or set $OPENAI_BASE_URL to
“https://api.mistral.ai/”. Prefer setting command line option --mistral
for complete integration.

For Ollama, set option -O (--ollama), and set $OLLAMA_BASE_URL if the
server URL is different from the defaults.

Note that model management (downloading and setting up) must follow the
Ollama project guidelines and own methods.

For Google Gemini, set environment variable $GOOGLE_API_KEY, and run the
script with the command line option --google.

For Groq, set the environmental variable $GROQ_API_KEY. Run the script
with option --groq. Transcription (Whisper) endpoint available.

For Anthropic, set envar $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and run the script with
command line option --anthropic.

For GitHub Models, $GITHUB_TOKEN and invoke the script with
option --github.

For Novita AI integration, set the environment variable $NOVITA_API_KEY
and use the --novita option (legacy).

Likewise, for xAI Grok, set environment $XAI_API_KEY with its API key.

And for DeepSeek API, set environment $DEEPSEEK_API_KEY with its API
key.

Run the script with option --xai and also with option -cc (chat
completions.).

Some models also work with native text completions. For that, set
command-line option -c instead.

COLOR THEMES

The colour scheme may be customised. A few themes are available in the
template configuration file.

A small colour library is available for the user conf file to
personalise the theme colours.

The colour palette is composed of $Red, $Green, $Yellow, $Blue, $Purple,
$Cyan, $White, $Inv (invert), and $Nc (reset) variables.

Bold variations are defined as $BRed, $BGreen, etc, and background
colours can be set with $On_Yellow, $On_Blue, etc.

Alternatively, raw escaped color sequences, such as \u001b[0;35m, and
\u001b[1;36m may be set.

Theme colours are named variables from Colour1 to about Colour11, and
may be set with colour-named variables or raw escape sequences (these
must not change cursor position).

CONFIGURATION AND CACHE FILES

User configuration is stored in ~/.chatgpt.conf. Its path location can
be set with envar $CHATGPTRC.

The script cache directory is ~/.cache/chatgptsh/ and may contain the
following file types:

-   Session Records (tsv): Tab-separated value files storing session
    history. The default session record is chatgpt.tsv.
-   Prompt Files (pr): Files storing user-defined custom instructions
    (initial prompts).
-   Command History (history_bash): Bash command-line input history.
    This file is trimmed according to the $HISTSIZE setting in the
    configuration file. While it improves session recall, a large
    history_bash file can slow down script startup. It can be safely
    removed if necessary.
-   Temporary Buffers: Various files holding temporary text and data.
    These files are safe to remove and are not intended for backup.

Backup Recommendation: It is strongly recommended to back up session
record files (tsv) and prompt files (pr), as well as the configuration
file (chatgpt.sh) to preserve session history, custom promptsnd
settings.

CAVEATS

The script objective is to implement some of the features of OpenAI API
version 1. As text is the only universal interface, voice and image
features will only be partially supported, and not all endpoints or
options will be covered.

This project does not support “Function Calling”, “Structured Outputs”,
“Real-Time Conversations”, “Agents/Operators”, “MCP Servers”, nor “video
generation / editing” capabilities.

Support for “Responses API” is limited and experimental at this point.

BUGS

Reasoning (thinking) and answers from certain API services may not have
a distinct separation of output due to JSON processing constraints.

Bash “read command” may not correctly display input buffers larger than
the TTY screen size during editing. However, input buffers remain
unaffected. Use the text editor interface for big prompt editing.

If readline screws up your current input buffer, try pressing <CTRL-L>
to force it to redisplay and refresh the prompt properly on screen.

File paths containing spaces may not work correctly in the chat
interface. Make sure to backslash-escape filepaths with white spaces.

Folding the response at white spaces may not worked correctly if the
user has changed his terminal tabstop setting. Reset it with command
“tabs -8” or “reset” before starting the script, or set one of these in
the script configuration file.

If folding does not work well at all, try exporting envar $COLUMNS
before script execution.

Bash truncates input on “\000” (null).

Garbage in, garbage out. An idiot savant.

The script logic resembles a bowl of spaghetti code after a cat fight.
